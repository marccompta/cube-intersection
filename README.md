# cube-intersection by \@Marc Compta Perpiña

## Motivation

Technical exercice.

Design and start an application which accepts as input dimensions and coordinates of two cubic objects (considering a 3D space). The application must determine whether the two objects collide and calculate the intersected volume.

It´s not a math exercice, so it is acceptable to consider the two cubes are parallel, so there is no rotation among themselves.

The input coordinates define the center of the cube.

The purpose of this exercice is to define the application design and architecture, focusing on the parts which ensure the correctness, performance and code clarity.

## Requirements

cube-intersection runs on .net core 3.1. Any device able to load and run the solution should be enough.

## Instructions

Just run the application. Details on the available endpoint should be provided to you via Swagger.
